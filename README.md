# Abstractify
Abstractify is a platform designed to simplify research by generating visual abstracts from research papers, making complex information more accessible and understandable. Built with the MERN stack and powered by Googleâ€™s Gemini model, Abstractify converts uploaded research PDFs into aesthetically cohesive abstracts, including diagrams, graphs, and key points. These visual summaries are dynamically rendered for quick, easy comprehension.

Key features include:
- Automated Visual Abstracts: The app generates a harmonious layout of summarized data, diagrams, and charts.
- Efficient Reuse of Data: Visual abstracts are saved in a global database, reducing regeneration time and token usage.
- Interactive React-Live Rendering: Uses React-Live to compile visual elements in real-time.
- User Profiles and Google OAuth: Secure user authentication and saved profiles for fast access to past abstracts.
- Abstractify transforms how users engage with academic papers, saving time and enhancing the research experience.
